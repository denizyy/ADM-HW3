Finally, once you have collected numerical information, you likely will have different currencies: this can be chaotic, so let chatGPT guide you in the choice and deployment of an API to convert this column to a common currency of your choice (it can be USD, EUR or whatever you want).

The method's flexibility in the -1 to 1 range allows for a more precise evaluation, where higher scores signify heightened similarity.

This homogeneity suggests a limitation in the Euclidean distance metric's ability to discriminate effectively between different entries. The observed lack of variability in scores indicates that the method struggles to capture nuanced differences in the data, potentially due to shortcomings in the feature representation or the choice of distance metric.\n",

They agreed __d__ days ago that Leonardo could not work less than $minTime_i$ or more than $maxTime_i$ hours per <ins>i-th</ins> day. Furthermore, he was warned by HR that on his last day at the company, he should provide a detailed report on how many hours he worked <ins>each day</ins> for the previous d days.\n",

He believes that if he creates a report in which each number $dayHours_i$ corresponds to the __total hours he worked on the i-th day__ while satisfying the HR limitations and the total sum of all $dayHours_i$ equals $sumHours$, he would be fine.\n",
