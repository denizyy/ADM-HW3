        "Although it is known that Cosine similarity provides a better measure of similarity than Euclidean distance when dealing with text data, when I compare the data results on the basis of this assignment, I can say that Euclidean distance gives a more consistent result. In the search engine where we use Cosine similarity and based only on description data, we see that the first rows contain irrelevant course names. I think the reason for this is that the description data is not limited and although preprocessing is done, it is a data set that contains irrelevant data. The data set we created by using Euclidean distance and adding faculty names appeared more consistent. And I must say that although expanding the data set allows us to look at it from different angles and more comprehensively, it becomes more difficult to analyze the data consistently. I experienced this while doing the homework. I cannot make a clear comparison between the similarity scores found using Cosine similarity and Euclidean distance. Similarity score value ranges also vary, and the Euclidean distance similarity score can take values greater than 1.\n"
